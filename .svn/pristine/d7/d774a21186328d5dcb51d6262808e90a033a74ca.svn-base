\section{Introduction}
Genomic profiling using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is 
widely used within precision medicine programs, in combination with DNA 
sequencing, to match specific molecular alterations (amplifications or 
deletions) with therapeutic orientations.\\
We present \Rpackage{rCGH}, a comprehensive array-based CGH analysis workflow,
integrating functionalities specifically designed for precision medicine. 
\Rpackage{rCGH} ensures a full traceability by saving all the process parameters
, and facilitates genomic profiles interpretation and decision-making through 
interactive visualizations.\\
\Rpackage{rCGH} supports Agilent (from 44K to 400K arrays), as well as
Affymetrix, SNP6 and cytoScanHD arrays.

\incfig[h]{workflowOverview.pdf}{.5\textwidth}{\Rpackage{rCGH workflow.}}
{The global rCGH analysis workflow}

\section{\Rpackage{rCGH} object structure}
In order to store (or update) data, sample information, and the workflow
parameters all along a genomic profile analysis process, \Robject{rCGH} objects
are structured as follow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{info}: the sample information.
    \item{cnSet}: the full by-probe dataset.
    \item{param}: the workflow parameters, for traceability.
    \item{segTable}: the segmentation data.
\end{itemize}

All these slots are accessible through specific functions, as described in the
next sections.
\\
Notice that \Rclass{rCGH} is a superclass designed for calling common methods.
Depending on the type of array and the \emph{read} functions used, the 
resulting objects will be assigned to classes \Rclass{rCGH-Agilent}, 
\Rclass{rCGH-SNP6}, or \Rclass{rCGH-cytoScan}. These classes inherit from the 
superclass, and allow array-specific pre-parametrizations.


\section{\Rpackage{rCGH} functions}
\Rpackage{rCGH} provides functions for each of the analysis steps, from reading 
files to visualizing genomic profiles. Several \emph{get} functions allow the 
user to get access to specific results and workflow parameters, saved and stored
at each step.

\subsection{Reading files}
Both Agilent Feature Exraction files (from 44K to 400K arrays), and Affymetrix 
SNP6 and cytoScanHD, data are supported.\\
However, and to keep more flexibility, Affymetrix CEL files have to be first
read using ChAS or Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) \cite{Affy}, and then exported
as cychp.txt or cnchp.txt files.\\
Notice that cnchp.txt files contain Allelic differences, that allow the loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) to be estimated, while cychp.txt files do not.

Due to specific files structures, and since preambles may be missing (depending
on ChAS and APT versions), \Rpackage{rCGH} as 3 specific read/build-object
functions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\Rfunction{readAgilent()}}: 44K to 400K FE (.txt) files.
    \item{\Rfunction{readAffySNP6()}}: cychp, cnchp and probeset (.txt) files,
    exported from SNP6.0 CEL.
    \item{\Rfunction{readAffyCytoScan()}}: cychp, cnchp and probeset (.txt)
    files, exported from CytoScanHD CEL.
\end{itemize}

Each of these functions take the file's path as the unique mandatory argument.\\
Optional arguments allow the user to save the following information: 
\emph{sampleName, labName}:

\vspace{5mm}

<<readFiles, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE>>=
library(rCGH)
filePath <- system.file("extdata", "Affy_cytoScan.cyhd.CN5.CNCHP.txt.bz2",
    package = "rCGH")
cgh <- readAffyCytoScan(filePath, sampleName = "CSc-Example",
                        labName = "myLab")
@

<<cgh, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE>>=
cgh
@

In complement, any kind of useful annotation (logical, string or numeric) can be
added, with \Rfunction{setInfo()}:

\vspace{5mm}

<<addInfo>>=
setInfo(cgh, "item1") <- 35
setInfo(cgh, "item2") <- TRUE
setInfo(cgh, "item3") <- "someComment"
@

At any time, the full (or specific) annotations stored can be accessed:

\vspace{5mm}

<<getInfo>>=
getInfo(cgh)
getInfo(cgh, c("item1", "item3"))
@


\subsection{Adjusting signals}
When Agilent dual-color hybridization are used, GC content and the cy3/cy5 bias 
are necessary adjustments.  \Rfunction{adjustSignal()} handle these steps 
before computing the $\log_2\left( Relative Ratios \right)$ (LRR). In both 
cases, a local regression (\Rfunction{loessFit}, R package \Rpackage{limma})
is used \cite{Smyth}.
\\
Note that by default, the cyanine3 signal is used as the reference. Use 
\Rcode{Ref=cy5} if cyanine5 signal has to be used as the reference.
\\
When Affymetrix cychp or cnchp files are used, these steps have already been 
done, and \Rfunction{adjustSignal()} simply rescale the LRR, when
\Rcode{Scale=TRUE} (default). As for Agilent data, some useful quality 
scores: the derivative Log Ratio Spread (dLRs) and the LRR Median Absolute 
Deviation (MAD), are stored in the object.

\vspace{5mm}

<<adjustSignal>>=
cgh <- adjustSignal(cgh, nCores=1)
@


\subsection{Centering LRR}
Centering LRR is a key step in the genomic analysis process since it defines 
the base line (the expected 2-copies level) from where gains ad losses are
estimated. To do so, LRRs are considered as a mixture of several gaussian
populations , and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to 
estimate their parameters.
\\
The centralization value is chosen according to the user specification: the mean
of the sub-population with a density peak higher than a given proportion of the
highest density peak \cite{Commo}. The default value is 0.5. Setting
\Rcode{peakThresh = 1} leads to choose the highest density peak.
\\
The \Rfunction{plotDensity()} function gives access to a graphical check on how 
the centralization step worked, and what LRR population has been chosen for 
centering the profile:

\vspace{5mm}

<<EMnormalize>>=
# Resricted to 3 groups for the purpose of that demo.
cgh <- EMnormalize(cgh, G = 3)
@

\vspace{5mm}

<<plotDensity, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.show='hide'>>=
plotDensity(cgh)
@

\incfig[h]{figure/plotDensity-1}{.75\textwidth}{plotDensity.}
{\Rfunction{plotDensity()} shows how \emph{EM} models the \emph{LRR}
distribution, and what peak is chosen for centralizing the profile (in bold).}


\subsection{Segmenting}
One possible strategy for segmenting the genome profile consists in identifying 
breakpoints all along the genome, when exist. These breakpoints define the DNA 
segments start and end positions. To do so, \Rpackage{rCGH} uses the Circular 
Binary Segmentation algorithm (\emph{CBS}) \cite{Venkatraman} from the 
\Rpackage{DNAcopy} package \cite{dnacopy}.
\\
All the steps are wrapped into one unique easy-to-use function,
\Rfunction{segmentCGH()}. In order to faclitate its use, all the parameters but
one are predefined: \Rcode{UndoSD} is kept free. When this parameter is set to
\Rcode{NULL} (default), its optimal value is estimated directly from the values.
However, the user can specify its own value, generaly from 0.5 to 1.5.\\
The resulting segmentation table is of the form of a standard
\Rpackage{DNAcopy} output, plus additional columns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{ID} : sample Id.
    \item{chrom}   : chromosome number.
    \item{loc.start}  : segment start position.
    \item{loc.end}  : segment end position.
    \item{num.mark} : number of markers within each segment.
    \item{seg.mean} : the mean LRR along each segment.
    \item{seg.med}  : the median LRR along each segment.
    \item{probes.Sd} : the LRR standard deviation along each segment.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}

<<SegmentCGH>>=
cgh <- segmentCGH(cgh, nCores=1)
segTable <- getSegTable(cgh)
head(segTable)
@

Note that such data format allows GISTIC-compatible inputs to be exported
\cite{Mermel}.


\subsection{Parallelization}
\Rpackage{rCGH} allows parallelization within \Rfunction{EMnormalise()} and
\Rfunction{segmentCGH()}, through \Rfunction{mclapply()} from R package
\Rpackage{parallel}.\\
By default, \Rcode{nCores} will be set to half of the available cores, but any
value, from 1 to \Rfunction{detectCores()}, is allowed. However, this feature
is currently only available on \texttt{Linux} and \texttt{OSX}: \Rcode{nCores}
will be automatically set to 1 when a \texttt{Windows} system is detected.


\subsection{Getting the by-gene table}
The next step consists in getting access to the potentially altered genes. 
\Rfunction{byGeneTable()} extracts the list of genes included in each segment, 
and constructs a dataset, easy to export and to manipulate outside R.
The final genes' list combines position information from  
\Biocannopkg{TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene}, and annotations from
\Biocannopkg{org.Hs.eg.db}.

\vspace{5mm}

<<byGeneTable>>=
#geneTable <- byGeneTable(cgh)
geneTable <- byGeneTable(segTable)
head(geneTable, n=3)
@


\subsection{Accessing the analysis parameters}
For traceability and reproducibility, it may be useful to keep track to a
profile analysis parameters. At each step, the workflow parameters, defined by
default or specified by the user, are stored in a \Rcode{params} slot. 
They are accessible at any time using \Rfunction{getParam()}.

\vspace{5mm}

<<getParams>>=
getParam(cgh)[1:3]
@


\subsection{Visualizing the genomic profile}
In a context of Precision Medicine, visualizing and manipulating a genomic 
profile is crucial to interpret imbalances, to identify targetable genes, and 
to make decisions regarding a potential therapeutic orientation.
In many situations, considering LOH can also help to better interpret
imbalances.
\\
\Rpackage{rCGH} provides 2 ways for visualizing a genomic profile: 
\Rfunction{plotProfile()}, \Rfunction{plotLOH()} and \Rfunction{multiplot()} are
simple static ways to visualize a profile, possibly with some tagged gene,
while \Rfunction{view()} is a more sophisticated and interactive visualization
method, build on top of shiny. A control panel allows the user to interact with
the profile, and to export the results.
\\
Notice that \Rfunction{plotLOH()} and \Rfunction{multiplot()} are relevant only
in case the allelic difference is available, namely when Affymetrix cnchp.txt
files are used.


\subsubsection{Static profile visualizations}
\Rfunction{plotProfile()} allows the genomic profile visualization. Any gene(s)
of interest can be added to the plot by passing a valid HUGO symbol.
Other arguments can be used to color the segments according to specified
gain/loss thresholds, or to change the plot title.
\\
Two other static functions can be useful for reporting alterations:
\Rfunction{plotLOH()} to analyse the LOH, and \Rfunction{multiplot()} to build 
a full report, including both the genomic profile and the LOH.

\vspace{5mm}

<<getProfile, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=7, fig.show='hide'>>=
multiplot(cgh, c("egfr", "erbb2"))
@

\pagebreak

\incfig[h]{figure/getProfile-1}{.95\textwidth}{Static views.}
{
\Rfunction{multiplot()} provides static visualisations combining the genomic
profile and the LOH.
}

\pagebreak

\subsubsection{Recentering}
When the profile centering doesn't seem appropriate, \Rfunction{recenter()}
allows the user to choose another centralization value. The new choice
has to be specified as the peak index to use: peaks are indexed, from 1 to k (
from left to right) as they appear on the density plot.

\vspace{5mm}

<<recenter, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4, fig.show='hide'>>=
# Recentering on peak #3
recenter(cgh) <- 3
plotProfile(cgh, "erbb2")
@

\incfig[h]{figure/recenter-1}{.95\textwidth}{Recentering.}
{
By default, the EM-based normalization choose a possibly optimal peak to 
center the profile, but any other peak can be chosen, using
\Rfunction{recenter()}.
}


\subsubsection{Interactive visualization}
The \Rpackage{view()} function provides a more flexible way for analyzing a 
genomic profile, and allows interactive graph manipulations through a 
control panel: defining the gain/loss thresholds, displaying a gene, resizing 
the y-axis, selecting one unique chromosome, and recentering the entire profile.
Note that the \emph{Genes table} is updated whenever changes are made through 
that control panel, e.g. selecting one unique chromosome on the graph filters
the \emph{Genes table} on that chromosome, simultaneously.
\\
The Download buttons, \emph{Plot}, \emph{LOH} and \emph{Table}, allow plots and
gene table to be exported, as they have been modified.

\pagebreak

The \Rfunction{view()} control panel:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Gene Symbol} : display any existing gene, providing its official 
    HUGO symbol.
    \item{Show chromosome} : display the entire profile (default is 'All'),
    or one specific chromosome.
    \item{Gain/Loss colors} : choose blue/red or red/blue.
    \item{Recenter profile} : recenter the profile on-the-fly. Gene values
    are updated in the 'Genes table'.
    \item{Merge segments...} : merge segments shorter than the specified
    value, in Kb. Gene values are updated in the 'Genes table'.
    \item{Recenter profile} : recenter the profile on-the-fly. Gene values
    are updated in the 'Genes table'.
    \item{Rescale max(y)} : adjust the top y-axis (0<y) using a proportion 
    of the maximum value.
    \item{Rescale min(y)} : adjust the bottom y-axis (y<0) using a 
    proportion of the minimum value.
    \item{Gain threshold (Log2ratio)} : define the gain threshold. 
    Segments higher than this value are colored according to the chosen color
    code, and the 'Genes table' is filtered, consequently.
    \item{Loss threshold (Log2ratio)} : same as 'Gain threshold' but for 
    losses.
    \item{Download - Profile} : download the profile as it is displayed on the
    screen, including modifications.
    \item{Download - LOH} : download the LOH plot as it is displayed on the
    screen, including modifications.
    \item{Download - Table} : download the 'Genes table', including
    modifications.
\end{itemize}

\section{Notes regarding the example files}
In order to reduce the computation time, we provide subsets of real data for
the 3 supported platforms:

\vspace{5mm}

<<exampleFiles>>=
list.files(system.file("extdata", package = "rCGH"))
@

\bioccomment{
\\
In order to speed up demos, the provided example files contain only a subset of
the original probes.\\
Affymetrix example files (cytoScan and SNP6) only contain SNP
probes. Setting \Rcode{useProbes = "cn"} in \Rcode{readAffy} functions should
return an error.
}
