rCGH package 0.99.10
-----------------------

BUG FIXES
    * In byGeneTable(): errors may occured when genes were searched
    on too short segments.



rCGH package 0.99.9
-----------------------

BUG FIXES
    * In view() function: segment colors were not properly assigned.



rCGH package 0.99.8
-----------------------

BUG FIXES
	* Error when merging probes with duplicated locations on
    Agilent CytoGenomics 3.0: fixed.



rCGH package 0.99.7
-----------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    * byGeneTable() is not a S4 method anymore but S3: as argument, it takes a
    segmentation table exported from a rCGH object, and not the object itself.
    As a consequence, byGeneTable() can be used on any segmentation table of the
    same form as those exported from a rCGH object.

    * The full by-gene table is not stored in rCGH object, but built then
    exported on the fly, using byGeneTable().
    
    * Supplementary argument in getSegTable(): minLen allows the user to
    specify the minimal segment length, in Kb. Segments shorter than this value
    are merged before the segmentation table is exported. The original table is
    still stored in the rCGH object.
    
    * New features in plotProfile() and multiplot(): one or multiple genes can
    be tagged. As for getSegTable(), the minimal segment length (in Kb) can be
    specified.

    * Server version for the interactive viewer is described in the vignette.

BUG FIXES
    * byGeneTable:
        . In the exported by-gene table, the corresponding segment lengths were
        not properly reported.

        . Errors occured when a gene was covered by 2 segments.
